It was a sunny afternoon in Paris.Chris was having the best day of his life as after all he was with his then crush ,now girlfriend.
They decided to watch a movie together.They went to the cinema.Soon a person from behind tapped on his shoulder, and asked for his tickets.
He searched all over his pockets ,he was sweating of fear as he could not find it. The ticket collector slapped him. Chris screamed only to be found he was in bed.
That was all his dream. Chris hopes that someday he would be together with his crush.
thank you
